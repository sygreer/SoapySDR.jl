# SoapySDR.jl

This package has been moved to [https://github.com/JuliaTelecom/SoapySDR.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTelecom/SoapySDR.jl), and will no longer be maintained here.

*** 

This is a Julia wrapper for [SoapySDR](https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR/wiki) to enable SDR processing in Julia. See [this Jupyter notebook](examples/SoapySDR.jl.ipynb) for an example.

This was a final project for 18.337/6.338 at MIT Fall 2018.
